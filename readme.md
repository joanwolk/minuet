# Minuet

Minuet is a player for SoundCloud sounds of all kinds.

## What are the goals of Minuet?
- Use pure JavaScript and CSS
- Create a listening queue with any SoundCloud sounds
	- The queue will not store sounds long-term after they've been listened to, but will retain the last 5 sounds to allow users to like something they've just heard (making future retrieval easier)
	- The queue will allow users to add, remove, and re-order sounds
	- UI and continuous playback will work on mobile devices
		- Use mobile-first development
		- Test with Jasmine
		- Ignore legacy browsers
- [Be appealing and intuitive](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Minuet)
